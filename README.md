Typecast.js version 0.2
===========

In a sentence, Typecast solves all the simple problems, so you can focus on the big ones.

Typecast fixes what's wrong with Javascript by creating a complete foundation for variable typing in Javascript. It works both in a browser and on Node.js servers. Typecast pairs well with jQuery and does not modify any native javascript methods. Typecast does not require a custom compiler like CoffeeScript, TypeScript or Clojure. 

Typecast is a replacement to underscore.js. Underscore provides 60 helper functions for 13k, while for only 10k more, Typecast provides over 200 additional helper functions. Typecast speeds development by reducing the length and variety of code required to complete common programming tasks, reducing both bugs and troubleshooting time.
