Typecast.js
===========

In a sentence, Typecast solves all the simple problems, so you can focus on the big ones.

Typecast fixes what's wrong with Javascript by creating a complete platform for strongly-typed variables in Javascript. It works both in a browser and on Node.js servers. Typecast pairs well with jQuery by providing strongly typed variables without altering Javascript's native prototypes or requiring a custom compiler such as CoffeeScript, TypeScript or Clojure. 

Typecast is a replacement to underscore.js. Underscore provides 60 helper functions for 13k, while for only 10k more, Typecast provides over 300 additional helper functions. Typecast speeds development by reducing the length and variety of code required to complete common programming tasks, reducing both bugs and troubleshooting time.
